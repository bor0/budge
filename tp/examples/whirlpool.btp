## Part 1 — The Paradox

# Any mental search is already a whirlpool
rSearchIsWhirlpool : SEARCH(x) -> WHIRLPOOL(SEARCH(x))

pOpening : The programmer mind defaults to SEARCH — reaching for a system, a fix, an escape.

# The programmer, stuck, reaches for a system to escape
tmSearchForEscape!  : rTmSearch x=tmEscape!

# That search is itself a whirlpool
thParadox           : rSearchIsWhirlpool x=tmEscape! tmSearchForEscape!

pDeepens : Noticing the trap, the mind searches for escape from that whirlpool too. It deepens.

# Searching for escape from *that* whirlpool deepens it further
tmSearchDeeper!     : rTmSearch x=thParadox
thDeepened          : rSearchIsWhirlpool x=thParadox tmSearchDeeper!

## Part 2 — Two Responses

pFusion : Response A: fuse with it. Become the whirlpool. It grows.

# Response A: Fusion — identifying with the whirlpool amplifies it
rFusedAmplifies     : FUSED(x) -> AMPLIFY(x)

tmFused!            : rTmFused x=thDeepened
thAmplified         : rFusedAmplifies x=thDeepened tmFused!

pNoticing : Response B: notice it. Step back. The observer is not the whirlpool.

# Response B: Noticing — observing the whirlpool from outside defuses it
rNoticingDefuses    : NOTICING(x) -> DEFUSE(x)
rDefuseToPresent    : DEFUSE(x) -> PRESENT

tmNoticing!         : rTmNoticing x=thParadox
thDefused           : rNoticingDefuses x=thParadox tmNoticing!

pResolution : The whirlpool does not vanish. It is simply no longer you.

thPresent           : rDefuseToPresent x=thParadox thDefused
